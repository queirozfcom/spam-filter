### KEYWORDS (we should use them (explaining them would be better actually) in our report to ensure high marks)
 - Curse of dimensionality (what is it?)
 - Bayes' theorem (quick explanation)
 - Naïve bayes algorithm(why is it called naïve and how does it work?)
  - different types (gaussian,multinomial,bernoulli,ou-of-core (how do they differ?))
 - Supervised learning (what is it? how's it different from unsupervised learning?)
 - Confusion Matrix (what is it? what does it say?)
 - How well did our model do? There are many ways to measure it:
  - accuracy
  - precision
  - recall
  - f1
 - bias/variance tradeoff (maybe talk about this, not sure)
 - overfitting/underfitting
